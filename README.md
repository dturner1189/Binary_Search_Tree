# Binary (Search) Tree Structure in C

This is an implementation of a binary tree data structure. Users may interact with the driver file to use their own inputs. This program is capable of Insertions, Deletions, Printing elements at depth N, Searching, Determining the number of Leaf nodes, Depth of tree and Printing the chain of elements and how they relate to one another.  

## What This Is

This is an easy to understand implementation of a Binary Tree data structure.

### Running

Unix users proceed with the following commands in your terminal:

```
$ ./run.sh
```

Windows users will need to compile themselves. Simply run the executable after compilation. I use gcc. There are no crazy libraries here only stdlib and stdio.

### Manifest


```
makefile
```
Compilation instructions for users machines.


```
run.sh
```

Setup utility for (\*)nix users.

```
driver.c
```
Where user can modify and play around with the list structure using their own data.

```
bst.c
```

Main c code portion, definitions, implementations , interface utils, etc.

```
bst.h
```

declarations of functions as well as the node struct.
